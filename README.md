# Music-Player
Inspired by Spotify's music player, I set out to make my own music player using Python, Tkinter, and Pygame. 
Limited by Tkinter's ancient UI tools, I obviously fell short of copying Spotify's elegant UI but I did make sure that the player contained the basic functionality that any music player should have.
Start | Pause | Stop | Volume Control | Status Bar | The ability to load any song

The player works by prompting you to select an MP3 file that exists locally on your desktop, after which you play it. 
Libraries used: Tkinter (for the UI) and Pygame (for the audio functionality)
